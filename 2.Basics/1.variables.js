// don't use var, has problem, later it is explained
let name = "Imam";
console.log(name);

// if we want 2 variables together
let firstName, lastname;
//but modern best practise
let firstNameMe = "Imam";
let lastNameMe = "Hossain";

// ## rules ##
// can't be reserved keyword like if,for
// should be meanigful
// can't start with a number
// can't contain a space or hypen(-)
// are case sensitive ex- firstName,FirstName are different
